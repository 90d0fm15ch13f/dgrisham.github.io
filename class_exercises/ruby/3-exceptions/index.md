Exception Handling
==================

Exception handling is another one of those concepts that seems less important
when you're writing code for a course, but becomes crucial in production code.
Languages vary quite a bit in the tools they provide for exception handling --
for example, the general approach taken by Java, C++, Ruby, and Python is
syntactically noisier and, arguably, less semantically orthogonal than Go's
approach; Haskell (which we won't talk much about today) lets the programmer
build error handling into the types, so that the program logic code is
completely separate from the error handling code.

The first of the following three sections discuss exception handling in Java,
C++, and Ruby, resp.; the fourth section gives an overview of alternative means
of handling errors and primarily focuses on Go. Whenever you see the word
**Exercise**, you should complete the corresponding task -- be sure to questions
if you get stuck on anything! Get out a piece of paper, because there are a few
places where you'll be asked to write something down for class participation.

1.  [Java](sections/1-java.md)
2.  [C++](sections/2-cpp.md)
3.  [Ruby](sections/3-ruby.md)
4.  [Alternatives](sections/4-alternatives.md)

Be sure to turn in your group's paper at the end to get your participation
points!
