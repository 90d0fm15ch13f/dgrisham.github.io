Homework: Ruby Regular Expressions
==================================

Purpose
-------

-   Learn to use basic regular expressions in Ruby

Preparation
-----------

-   Download the [unit tests](src/regex_practice_tester.rb)

This exercise may be done with a partner.

Regex
-----

This assignment provides practice with some of the basic regular expression
capabilities. You should:

1.  Download the unit tests, name the file `regex_practice_tester.rb`.
2.  Create a module named `RegexPractice` in a file named `regex_practice.rb`.
3.  Write the required methods (pay attention to hints). When you run
    `regex_practice_tester.rb` your output should be similar to the output
    below(i.e., 26 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors).

```
$ ruby regex_practice_tester.rb
Run options: --seed 14369

# Running:

.......

Finished in 0.005669s, 1234.7171 run/s, 4586.0920 assertion/s.

7 runs, 26 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```
